<p><font size=+1><b><i>Summary:</i></b> Morphological identification of
nematodes usually requires permanent slides for detailed observation. This
significantly limits the range of research methods that can be applied
to such specimens. Permanent slides are never truly permanent, as taxonomically
important reference material may be lost by accident, or degrades slowly
over time. In order to efficiently record the morphology of nematodes,
in a format that allows easy archiving, editing and distribution, we have
assembled and tested two micrographic Video Capture and Editing (VCE) configurations.
These comparatively inexpensive, easily customized systems allow for the
production of short video clips that mimic multifocal observation of nematode
specimens through a light microscope. These clips can be used for many
purposes, including teaching and training, management and online access
of taxonomic collections, routine screening of fixed or unfixed specimens,
recording of ephemeral staining patterns, or recording of freshly dissected
internal organs prior to their decomposition. We provide details on the
components and operation of both systems, evaluate their efficiency in
the aforementioned applications, and provide illustrations of the obtained
image quality. We expect this approach to become widely used in nematology
research and teaching.</font>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>

<p><br><a NAME="intro"></a>Most nematodes are transparent micro-invertebrates,
and the light microscope (LM) is therefore the first-line tool for nematode
identification. This will undoubtedly remain true for a long time, despite
the proliferation in recent decades of various ultrastructural and molecular
techniques. Unfortunately, many situations occur in which a specimen's
micro-morphological characters are irreversibly lost. For example, type
specimens deposited in taxonomic reference collections deteriorate inevitably,
and are sometimes accidentally lost or damaged, while teaching material
often gets destroyed by inexperienced hands long before preservation fails.
Specimens prepared for histochemical studies or Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) lose transparency during staining or coating protocols, and often
deteriorate within hours, days or weeks. Certain kinds of observations
on internal structures, such as the cellular architecture of the female
gonad, can only be made on freshly dissected specimens, which usually plasmolyse
and decompose quickly. Even more drastically, techniques such as Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) and molecular analysis require the destruction
of the nematode being studied, as a prerequisite to the extraction of ultrastructural
or macromolecular data.
<p>Loss of optical morphology of a specimen invariably interferes with
subsequent verification of previous identifications and observations. It
also complicates procedures for applying multiple methodologies to the
same individual nematode. For example, although it is possible to obtain
DNA sequence data from single nematodes fixed years earlier in formalin
(Dorris &amp; Blaxter, pers. comm.), chances of success are highest when
DNA extraction is performed soon after fixation (<a href="vcerefs.html#thomas97">Thomas
<i>et al.</i>, 1997</a>) in order to maximize succesful PCR amplification.
And regardless of the time elapsed since fixation, at least part of the
specimen must inevitably be destroyed. Some of the consequences are, (i)
that morphology-based identification of an individual nematode must essentially
be complete before its molecular analysis can begin, (ii) that curators
of reference collections can rarely permit attempts at molecular analysis
of older type specimens, and (iii) that it constrains practical feasibility
of large-scale surveys of nematode diversity combining morphological and
molecular data of each individual.
<p>For many years, line drawings and still photographs have acted as the
sole means of illustrating, distributing and preserving LM-visible morphology.
Both types of images have important drawbacks. First, they depend on the
skills of the person producing them (especially so for line drawings),
and second, they simplify or omit three-dimensional topology of structures
(especially so for still photos). <a href="vcerefs.html#eisenback">Eisenback
(1988)</a> presented a simple method for superimposing several focal planes
in one photomicrograph, but this method is only applicable to a maximum
of five focal planes, and the act of superimposition reduces contrast per
focal plane, as well as discarding all topological information along the
focal axis.
<p>We have therefore set out to find alternative approaches for recording
the morphological characters of nematodes as seen with LM. Taking cues
from four-dimensional microscopy, as utilized in comparative embryology
of nematodes for multifocal image recording through time (<a href="vcerefs.html#thomas96">Thomas
et al., 1996</a>; <a href="vcerefs.html#schnabel">Schnabel <i>et al.</i>,
1997</a>), we have assembled two simplified, non-automated configurations
for multifocal recording of nematode morphology. We assembled both general-purpose
Video Capture and Editing (VCE) systems from inexpensive and widely available
components, tested them and developed simple protocols for the recording,
optimization and distribution of multifocal images of nematode specimens.
The resulting video files can easily be exchanged on disk or through networks,
and can be viewed with various widely distributed video player programs.
<p>In this paper we describe the various components and protocols used
for our VCE installations, as well as their relevant functions, problems
and observed disadvantages. We conclude that VCE has a wide range of possible
uses in nematological teaching and research, and that it is complementary
to still photography rather than a direct methodological competitor or
replacement.
