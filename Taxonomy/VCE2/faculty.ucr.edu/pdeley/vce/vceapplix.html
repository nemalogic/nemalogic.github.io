<h3>
Applications and modifications of the basic VCE protocol</h3>

<p><br>Based on the developed procedures, we have tested the quality (<a href="vcefig3.html">Fig.
3</a>, <a href="vcefig4.html">Fig. 4</a>, <a href="http://faculty.ucr.edu/~pdeley/vCenema1/Rbridgei/femalelipregion.mov">Fig.
5</a>), resulting file size and time load (<a href="vcetab5.html">Table
5</a>) of producing VCE files for a number of different purposes.
<h4>
<u>a) Recording for websites:</u></h4>
VCE files can easily be incorporated into web pages, allowing internet
users around the world to view the captured part of a specimen as if it
were positioned under a microscope. However, current limits to download
speeds make it impractical to have to access a file that is several Mb
large, especially if one is connected by means of a modem rather than an
Ethernet or Local Area Network connection. For basic website purposes,
it is therefore better to produce smaller files by compromising somewhat
on quality and/or using more efficient codecs such as "<a href="http://www.sorenson.com/index.asp">Sorenson</a>".
Web-connected users who do not have recent versions of video playing software,
will in most cases be able to update their software online, and obtain
newer versions that include the newer codecs.
<p>First, using only half of the available resolution (360 x 270) but the
high data transfer rate of 4000 kbps, we produced very modestly sized files
after compression with the "<a href="http://www.cinepak.com/begin.html">Cinepak</a>"
codec. (see <i>Radopholus bridgei
</i>in
<a href="vcetab5.html">Table 5</a>).
Although clearly inferior to direct observation with LM, these low-resolution
files nevertheless contained sufficient detail to capture and label many
important characters, illustrating that a VCE file can offset lower frame
resolution to an important degree by its multifocal information contents,
compared to a single still image captured at high resolution. Next, we
tried a limited data rate during capture, but this resulted in negligible
differences in file size of the final clip (see
<i>Prionchulus punctatum</i>,<i>
</i>with and without limited data rate during capture,<a href="vcetab5.html">Table
5</a>). In order to produce acceptable clips for websites, it is therefore
sufficient to limit resolution during clip exporting.

<h4>
<u>b) Recording demonstration material for disk access:</u></h4>
If the purpose is to provide students and inexperienced users with a detailed
overview of important mophological structures, then it is sufficient to
capture only those parts of a specimen that are relevant, such as the lip
region, all or part of the pharynx, all or part of the repoductive system,
and the tail. The files can be opened and read from CD-ROM, or preferably
copied to and opened from hard disk for maximal playback speed, without
the constraints imposed by download speed. Each multifocal series can therefore
be captured at maximal resolution (in our case, 720 x 540 pixels) and with
high data transfer rate. Click <a href="annotated.html">here</a>
for some examples.
<p>Capturing the various body regions takes very little time in itself,
but for maximum transfer of knowledge it is best to use the titling facilities
of the video editor to their fullest, by naming all informative or interesting
structures, and adding arrows to point them out <i>in those frames where
they occur only</i> (<a href="http://faculty.ucr.edu/~pdeley/vCenema1/Rbridgei/femalelipregion.mov">Fig.
5</a>). This titling step is much more time-consuming (<a href="vcetab5.html">Table
5</a>), especially during the first few attempts to utilise the various
functions. However, in our experience the result is an extremely effective
demonstration tool, especially when compared to traditional line drawings,
or having to point out structures through each student's LM in a full class.
Not only does it allow the viewer to learn to locate and distinguish each
structure, but it also greatly improves the three-dimensional perception
of inexperienced microscopists, by mimicking the focusing action of the
microscope, and encouraging the use of focusing as a tool for assessing
the relative positions of different structures at different transverse
levels in a transparent specimen.

<h4>
<u>c) Archiving large numbers of specimens and slides:</u></h4>
Many databasing and surveying applications benefit from an ability to link
one or more visual records to a text record of each collected specimen.
VCE clips can easily be linked to various popular database programs and
used for such purposes.
<p>In the case of nematodes, it is often useful to verify the appearance
and identification of specimens by taking a quick look at its lip region,
cardia, vulval or spicular region, and tail. VCE protocols can be used
to routinely capture and optimize these five body parts for large numbers
of nematode specimens, and the resulting VCE clips can then be included
in, or linked to, a database. Overall body shape and size can be captured
on a single still image at appropriate magnification (4x or 10x objective).
<p>Depending on space constraints, it may be advisable to restrict file
size of archive clips in the same ways as for website files, and "<a href="http://www.sorenson.com/index.asp">Sorenson</a>"
compression would then be preferable over "<a href="http://www.cinepak.com/begin.html">Cinepak</a>"
if the database will be used strictly by local access. However, we assume
that this problem will largely disappear with the ever-increasing capacity
and speed of hard disks, CD-writers and DVD-writers, as the download speeds
allowed on a Local Area Network are usually sufficient to handle quite
large VCE files.
<p>To test feasibility of routine screening and capturing of specimens,
we have therefore processed a series of 10 slides by capturing at 720 x
540 pixels and 4000 kbps, and timed the average duration per specimen at
22 minutes (<a href="vcetab5.html">Table 5</a>). No titling or scale bars
were added, as we assume that routine application would not allow for the
added time required per specimen, and in that case it is essential to document
each clip by including all relevant information in its file name, or in
a separate text file or database record.
<p>Furthermore, the 100x water immersion objective of Configuration 2 allows
screening and capture of nematodes immediately after extraction, without
any fixation or the need to place a coverslip over the specimens. We have
performed trial runs of sample screening, by heat-killing extracted nematodes
on a hot plate at 65<font face="Symbol">&amp;deg;</font> C, and then applying
VCE to specimens in an open drop of water on glass slides. Click <a href="screening.html">here</a>
for some examples. Although the 100x objective is inferior in resolution
to its oil immersion counterparts, it nevertheless provides images of sufficient
detail to allow rapid screening and archiving of nematodes, without requiring
the time investment and health risks of fixation and transfer to permanent
slides.
<p><b><a href="vceapplix.html#top">Back to top</a></b>
<h4>
<u>d) Recording type material as "image vouchers":</u></h4>
In this case the goal is to store an entire specimen digitally at maximal
resolution and at different magnifications, in order to produce a set of
reference files that can replace the type specimen for most purposes of
morphological and taxonomic studies. We therefore set out to determine
the amounts of time and disk space required for creating a "virtual type
specimen".
<p>For smaller nematodes like <i>Hemicriconemoides variodus, Panagrobelus
stammeri</i>, or <i>Plectonchus </i>n. sp.,<i> </i>the required number
of captured clips was fairly limited (up to about 30 files, cf. <a href="vcetab5.html">Table
5</a>), and it therefore took little time to give all edited files a name
including basic information such as taxon name, body part, slide number
and magnification. Also, in order to allow subsequent on-screen measurements,
we first recorded the scale on a calibration slide at each magnification,
as clips or TIFF files. For <i>H. variodus </i>and <i>Plectonchus</i> n.
sp., we then used the titling functions to construct a scale bar for each
magnification, and paste it into the appropriate clips with captured parts
of the specimen. We also titled each clip with taxon name and slide number.
<p>As appears from <a href="vcetab5.html">Table 5</a>, total processing
time for <i>H. variodus </i>and<i> Plectonchus</i> n.sp. was moderately
to significantly longer than that of <i>Panagrobelus stammeri</i>, where
we did not apply titling. In practice, adding titles may require too much
time when large numbers of type material need to be processed, and in this
case it may suffice to give each clip an informative name. Nevertheless,
to eliminate any confusion we would nevertheless recommend that titling
always be applied to at least the holotype.
<p>In larger nematodes like <i>Paraxiphidorus michelluci</i>, the number
of files required for complete capture becomes much too large to be feasible
without automation of the focusing and stage controls. It even becomes
too time-consuming to use detailed filenames, and in this case we therefore
just named the files as a numbered series for each magnification. In such
cases, an acceptable compromise is to capture an incomplete series of multifocal
files, by omitting only those parts of the body that are irrelevant to
diagnosis. Thus, we did not record those parts of the <i>P. michelluci</i>
holotype where the body only contained intestine, and this yielded file
numbers, time and disk requirements that proved more manageable.
<p>In order to keep track of all recorded parts of a completely or incompletely
captured specimen, we constructed clickable image maps to show the magnification
and display area of each VCE file. Click <a href="refspecs.html">here</a>
for some examples<i>.</i>However, the construction of this type of map
requires several hours more work, and we would therefore not recommend
it for routine VCE processing of type material.

<h4>
<u>e) Recording and documenting parts of dissected organs:</u></h4>
It is impossible to keep permanent mounts of dissected organs without drastic
reduction of quality. Furthermore, when one is interested in the cellular
architecture of these organs, then a clear three-dimensional overview is
indispensable. By preserving the multifocal nature of observations through
the microscope, our approach provides a relatively cheap and fast tool
for fulfilling both these demands, even in the absence of dedicated 3-D
software.
<p>The most informative components were recorded of several female nematode
gonads , i.e. the region around the spermatheca: end of the ovary, oviduct,
spermatheca and beginning of uterus (see <a href="vcefig4.html">Fig. 4</a>
for an example). In most cases, the region of interest could be captured
within the display area, and the production of a single videoclip was sufficient
to record the dissected structures. In those cases, capturing and editing
times were minimal: per gonad, we timed an average duration of only 4 minutes
without titles and 45 minutes with titles (<a href="vcetab5.html">Table
5</a>).
<p><b><a href="vceapplix.html#top">Back to top</a></b>
<h4>
<u>f) Recording the staining of specific cells:</u></h4>
In certain types of histological or molecular studies, results are visualized
by means of staining reactions in target cells or structures. In many cases,
this stain is not permanent, fading with prolonged exposure to light, due
to diffusion, and/or because of decomposition of the tissues. Capturing
the staining pattern with a VCE system allows the observer to permanently
record which cells or structures are stained. The basic procedure is the
same as for slide archiving (item b above). Obviously, a confocal microscopy
system will provide more detailed recording and resolution for this type
of application. However, the lower cost of adding VCE components to an
existing microscope, or even of buying a complete VCE system, will undoubtedly
make it an affordable alternative for many laboratories unable to budget
a confocal system.
<p>We tested a slightly modified regressive staining technique (essentially
carmine and propionic acid) based on <a href="vcerefs.html#khrustalev">Khrustalev
&amp; Hoberg (1996)</a>. Stained
<i>Panagrolaimus rigidus</i> specimens
were mounted directly in the destaining solution (50 % acetic acid and
70% ethanol), and we then captured a section of the intestine at several
time intervals during the destaining process. Afterwards, we could easily
select the clip with the best contrast between nuclei and background, thus
recording the cellular structure of the intestine on a whole mount individual.
The effective time spent on recording and editing of these clips was minimal
(see <a href="vcetab5.html">Table 5</a>).
