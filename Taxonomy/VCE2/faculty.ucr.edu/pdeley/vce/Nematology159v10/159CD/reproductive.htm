<h1>

The Reproductive System</h1></center>



<p><br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most nematode species have males

and females, although, depending on the mode of reproduction, in some cases

males are more rare than females/hermaphrodites.&nbsp;</font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=+2>The <a href="femalerepro.htm">female</a>

and <a href="malerepro.htm">male</a> reproductive systems are diverse in

configurations.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon closer examination, the female/hermaphrodite

and male reproductive tracts, enclosed by an epithelial sheath, include

highly specialized regions (7). In most nematodes the developing germ cells

progressively mature from the distal end marked by a cap cell, thus points

of maturation are distinguished as germinal zone and growth zone in both

the ovary and testis (7). In females/hermaphrodites the ovary leads to

an oviduct that may include a structure specialized for sperm storage,

the spermatheca (A). The spermatheca leads to a muscular uterus, that is

functionally involved in expelling eggs through the vagina to the vulva

opening (A). The testis may terminate at a seminal vesicle specialized

for storing sperm, and sometimes set off from the growth zone by a constricted

region, the vas efferens (B). Proximally a vas deferens leads to a common

duct with the digestive tract, the cloaca, thorugh which sperm are released.&nbsp;</font>

<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;</font>

<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the male and female/hermaphrodite

reproductive tracts may include a range of specialized glands.&nbsp;</font>
