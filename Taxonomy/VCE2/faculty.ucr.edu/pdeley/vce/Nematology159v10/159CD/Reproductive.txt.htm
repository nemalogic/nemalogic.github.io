<p><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>Most nematode species have males and
females, although, depending on the mode of reproduction, in some cases males
are more rare than females/hermaphrodites. The reproductive tract of the
female/hermaphrodite is essentially a tube filled with maturing eggs. Depending
on the species there may be one tube (a single gonad) (Fig. 5A, B) or there may
be two tubes (a pair of gonads); these systems are respectively called monodelphic
and didelphic. The reproductive tracts may be outstretched (Fig. 1A), reflexed
(Fig. 5B, C) or coiled (Fig. 5D). Tracts that are prodelphic are anteriorly
directed (Figs. 5 A,B, D), whereas didephic systems may be amphidelphic, having
tracts in opposing directions. Often monodelphic systems have a postvulvar sac,
a small chamber extending opposite to the gonad and posterior to the vulva
opening (Fig. 5A). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>Male nematodes also may have one gonad,
called monorchic and this may be reflexed anteriorly (Fig. 6A, B). A diorchic
male system has two gonads, typically oriented in opposing directions, but
joining at a shared duct (Fig. 6C).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>Upon closer examination, the
female/hermaphrodite and male reproductive tracts, enclosed by an epithelial
sheath, include highly specialized regions (Fig. 7). In most nematodes the
developing germ cells progressively mature from the distal end marked by a cap
cell, thus points of maturation are distinguished as germinal zone and growth
zone in both the ovary and testis (Fig. 7). In females/hermaphrodites the ovary
leads to an oviduct that may include a structure specialized for sperm storage,
the spermatheca (Fig. 7A). The spermatheca leads to a muscular uterus, that is
functionally involved in expelling eggs through the vagina to the vulva opening
(Fig. 7A). The testis may terminate at a seminal vesicle specialized for
storing sperm, and sometimes set off from the growth zone by a constricted
region, the vas efferens (Fig. 7B). Proximally a vas deferens leads to a common
duct with the digestive tract, the cloaca, thorugh which sperm are released.
The male reproductive system is associated with complex accessory structures
for mating (Fig. 8). These include a pair of cuticularized spicules which are
protrusible by a complex set of muscles (Fig. 8A). Together the spicules form a
conduit, visible in cross section, thorugh which sperm pass (Fig. 8B). The
spicules move in a channel that posteriorly may have a heavy cuticular lining,
the gubernaculum (Fig. 8). Both the male and female/hermaphrodite reproductive
tracts may include a range of specialized glands (Fig. 7). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
