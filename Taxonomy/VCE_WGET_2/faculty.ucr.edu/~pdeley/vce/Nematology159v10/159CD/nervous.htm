Nervous System</h1></center>



<center><font size=+2>Click <a href="nervousclips.htm">here</a> to see

some clips illustrating the nervous sytem</font></center>



<p><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp; The most prominent features of the nervous

system typically visible with the compound microscope are the nerve ring

and several sensory organs (C).&nbsp; The nerve ring appears as light colored

transverse fibers (nerve processes) surrounding the pharynx at the isthmus

or equivalent region.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font size=+2>Although sensory organs (sensilla) can occur any where

on the body, and they can be expressed in a wide range of structures, they

are especially abundant in the head and tail region (A, D).&nbsp; A typical

pattern in the head region includes, near the stoma opening, a circle of

six inner labial sensilla, a second circle of six outer labial sensilla,

and four cephalic sensilla.&nbsp; Sensilla on the head region and elsewhere

may be expressed as small bump-like elevations, papillae, that may or may

not open to the exterior, or they may be expressed as elongate hair-like

structures, setae (A).&nbsp; In addition, the head region includes openings

of two amphid sensory organs; these&nbsp; open on each lateral side (A).&nbsp;

Although the amphid opening often is a simple pore or slit, in some nematodes

it is a large concave circle, curved slit, or spiral trench.&nbsp; Some

nematodes also have a pair of deirids, small papilla-like sensory organs

on each lateral side posterior to the nerve ring (C).&nbsp;&nbsp; Rarely

pigmented lateral organs, ocelli, occur beneath the surface on the lateral

sides near the anterior end of the pharynx (C)</font>

<p><font size=+2>The tail is often rich in sensilla and many nematodes

have a pair of lateral sensory organs, phasmids, in this region.&nbsp;

Males of many nematodes have an array of papillae on the tail, and where

these occur in conjunction with caudal alae (bursa), they may be associated

with elongate rays (D).&nbsp;</font>
