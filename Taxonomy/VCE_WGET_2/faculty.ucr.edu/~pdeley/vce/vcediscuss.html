<h3>
<b>Basic strengths and weaknesses of VCE</b></h3>
Despite the limited resolution and some technical flaws, the tested configurations
were easy to use and yielded finished clips that were of acceptable image
quality and file size. Compared to film-based still photography, VCE was
in all respects faster, more versatile and more forgiving. Firstly, no
film development was required, so the captured clip could be checked instantaneously
for flaws, and retaken if necessary. Secondly, while it was very easy to
obtain still images from a clip, it was rather difficult and time-consuming
to photograph a continuous series of focusing levels &divide; all the more
so because it was not possible to check the result on the spot. Thirdly,
the video cameras had a much broader tolerance for low light conditions
and/or slight movements of the specimen. Although both situations did affect
image quality, fuzziness or graininess of the image became a problem much
less quickly than with still photography on film. Thus, it was quite difficult
to obtain a good series of still photographs of a freshly dissected gonad,
because the temporary mount still allowed for some movement of the specimen
due to muscular contractions and plasmolysis. By comparison, the VCE system
immediately yielded a good series of images of the same specimen (<a href="vcefig4.html">Fig.
4</a>).
<p>Digital still photography has many advantages over its film-based counterpart,
in that it matches or even exceeds the level of resolution, while bypassing
the development step. Digital still cameras are also rapidly becoming more
affordable and more compatible with microcomputers, and more advanced models
are increasingly combining still photography with video functions (albeit
at reduced resolution and frame rate).
<p>Compared to digital stills, analog video capture is limited in terms
of resolution attainable with existing cameras, but on the other hand it
provides a distinct advantage with respect to multifocal recording. Not
only does this allow capture of a series of focal planes in one quick operation,
but it also results in files that retain this focal series as a single
object, without necessarily using more disk space than a single high-resolution
digital still image. VCE and digital still photography are therefore complementary
rather than competing approaches: the latter is to be preferred when resolution
is critical, while the former is more appropriate for reproducing the focusing
action of a microscope, thereby translating three-dimensional topologies
into a series of two-dimensional optical sections.
<p>Undoubtedly, the distinction between digital stills and analog video
clips will disappear quickly if technological developments continue along
current lines. Digital video cameras are now becoming available, as well
as video capture cards that accept digital input (such as the tested DV500
capture card). Within the next few years, we can therefore expect prices
to drop and equipment to develop sufficiently rapidly to allow the use
of completely digital VCE configurations. In terms of computer hardware,
the process will become more and more efficient with the continued development
of larger computer memory chips, larger hard disks, faster processors,
faster internet connections, more efficient codecs and more powerful video
editors.
<p>Another relevant technological development, is image capture and digital
enhancement resulting in still images with Extended Depth of Field (EDF,
see <a href="http://epubs.osa.org/oearchive/source/9522.htm">Tucker et
al., 1999</a>), i.e. a much greater range of focus than allowed for by
standard optics. This approach holds great promise for the production of
single still images containing contrast-rich and focused structures occurring
at different levels, but as far as known to us, inexpensive systems are
not yet available on the market, and we are not aware of any examples where
EDF has already been applied to nematodes or other transparent invertebrates.
One problem could be that heavily sclerotized structures like buccal capsules
and stylets will blot out over- or underlying structures. Also, a VCE clip
preserves structural clues to angle of view and position of a specimen,
whereas an EDF image combines information from multiple standard focal
planes into a single omnifocal plane. In the case of nematodes, this could
mean that a clear single EDF image could be obtained of a nematode lip
region in sublateral view, with both amphids in focus, but without any
remaining clue allowing distinction between a dorso-sublateral and a ventro-lateral
angle of view. Practical application to nematode specimens will show whether
these concerns are important or not, and to what extent EDF can be combined
with VCE and other types of microscopy imaging.
<p>A last useful comparison that needs to be be made, concerns the performance
and uses of VCE as compared to Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM,
see e.g. <a href="vcerefs.html#czymmek">Czymmek et al., 1994</a>; <a href="vcerefs.html#donaldson">Donaldson
&amp; Lausberg, 1998</a>). The latter approach has many advantages, in
that it e.g. significantly enhances resolution, as well as relying on software
capable of measuring distances and constructing three-dimensional models.
We have not yet tested our configurations in the context of automated biometric
analyses, as the emphasis of the approach outlined here is on the recording
and representation of morphology itself, rather than on subsequent biomathematical
applications. Nevertheless, it is presumably possible to expand our hardware
and software to incorporate three-dimensional imaging functions (see e.g.
<a href="vcerefs.html#omasa">Omasa &amp; Kouda, 1998</a>).
<p>As a trade-off for the benefits, it should also be noted that CLSM systems
are significantly more expensive, and alter the properties of the microscope
itself in ways that make its use rather different from routine practice
in nematology, so that for most nematologists it is not a realistic option
to convert their research microscope into a CLSM system. By comparison,
adding the various components of a VCE system can be done at a much lower
cost and with greater ease, without modifying the basic properties of the
microscope itself.
