<h3>
<i>Equipment and software</i></h3>

<p><br>In accordance with the financial limitations imposed on the research
budget of most nematologists (including our own) we assembled a first basic
VCE configuration that was comparatively low-priced, not restricted for
use with any particular brand of microscope, and easily customized for
different laboratory environments and for a wide range of applications.
This setup is further referred to as Configuration 1 (<a href="vcefig1.html">Fig.
1</a>, <a href="config1.html" target="tables">Table
1</a>), and was used to establish the basic protocol outlined below and
summarized in <a href="vcesteps.html" target="figures">Fig.
2</a>.
<p>To compare the quality of the captured video images with still photography
on 35 mm film, multifocal series of pictures of some of the specimens captured
with Configuration 1 were also taken with an Olympus SC35 single-lens reflex
camera, mounted on the same microscope.
<p>Next, on the basis of our experience with Configuration 1, we assembled
a second version of the above system, including various updated components
allowing greater flexibility in magnification and more versatility in various
other aspects. Changes in this more expensive second setup, Configuration
2, included a separate video monitor, an optical magnification changer,
exchangeable 1x and 0.35x camera adapters, and a video capture card equipped
for both analog and digital video input (<a href="config2.html" target="tables">Table
2</a>).
<p>Also, in this second system we replaced the semi-apochromat 40x and
oil 100x objectives of Configuration 1 with a single apochromat oil 60x
objective, and compensated for lower on-screen magnification by utilising
a video camera with 1/3" CCD chip instead of a 1/2" CCD chip. The higher
numerical aperture of this 60x objective, in combination with the magnification
changer and exchangeable camera adapters, allowed capture of images that
were comparable in quality to those obtained with the first setup at highest
magnifications, but significantly better than those obtained with Configuration
1 at mid-range magnifications. We also added a water immersion 100x objective
of lower numerical aperture, to allow us to capture unfixed specimens on
slides without coverslip. Finally, the computer was equipped with two hard
drives, one fixed disk for program files and one removable disk for captured
files, to allow swapping with other computers for e.g. file backup.
<p>Except for the microscopes and optics of either system, we did not opt
for any video or computer components designed specifically for microscopy.
Instead, we chose general-purpose components that are aimed at more advanced
home users, readily available from many different electronics suppliers,
manufactured by companies that are among the market leaders in their respective
areas, and compatible with many models and brands of other components.
<p>We have not tested alternative brands for the optics, electronics and
software we haven chosen, and do not wish to claim or imply any preference
for the tested brands. Also, although our configurations were both based
on IBM-compatible computer components, various Macintosh-compatible hardware
and software counterparts exist and operate along identical principles.
As to our own configurations, the respective manufacturers of the different
components are listed in <a href="suppliers.html">Table 6</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<i>Protocols</i></h3>

<p><br>Experimentation with the two hardware and software configurations
led us to a series of general steps for obtaining edited video clips (<a href="vcesteps.html" target="figures">Fig.
2</a>, <a href="prot1tab.html" target="tables">Table
3</a>, <a href="prot2tab.html" target="tables">Table
4</a>).
<p>A first major stage consist of the capturing of multifocal series of
images, which actually involves two separate steps. First, the equipment
and software must be initialized in such a way that microscope images will
be transmitted correctly to the capture card, converted by the capture
software into acceptable real-time video images displayed on the computer
monitor, and stored in the proper folders of the computer's hard disk(s)
during actual capture.
<p>The next step is the capturing itself, of properly positioned parts
of a single specimen at a time. Capturing and specimen positioning can
be repeated as many times as necessary to record an entire body part at
highest magnification (e.g. pharynx, genital system, male tail region,
etc.), or even to record a complete specimen.
<p>The second stage consists of editing and compression of the captured
video clips. Although each source clip contains all the morphological information
provided by the combination of specimen, microscope and camera, it often
uses much more disk space and memory than strictly necessary, because usually
at least one of five kinds of redundancy (see <a href="vceglossary.html">glossary</a>)
occurs. Also, the clips can still be compressed by various algorithms,
without visible loss of image quality or extension of playback speed.
<p>Pixel redundancy is actually minimized before capture by selecting the
appropriate software settings in the initialization step. The four other
kinds of data redundancy must be minimised or removed after capture, using
video editing software included with the video capture card. The clip is
therefore edited more or less extensively to optimize its final size. As
an optional feature it is also possible to add text, scale bars and arrows
to some or all of its frames, so as to highlight e.g. structures that are
particularly important or hard to see.
<p>In the last stage, the edited clip is tested and verified on various
video player programs, to ensure that the end users will be able to play
it correctly, regardless of their particular hardware and software facilities.
<p>Optionally, if complete specimens were captured as a large series of
clips, then it is also possible to index the clips by means of an overview
of their position along the body of the specimen. We have done this by
constructing "image maps" in World Wide Web pages written in HTML and accessible
online or on disk through any WWW browser. On such an image map, a specimen
is depicted as a low-magnification image with clickable boxes or bars delineating
the different body parts captured at different magnifications, and providing
embedded HTML links to the corresponding video clips. When a given box
or bar is clicked, the appropriate clip will open automatically in the
video player software installed as plug-in of the browser used. We refer
to the aforementioned website for more details and examples.
