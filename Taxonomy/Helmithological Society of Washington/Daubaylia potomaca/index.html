    <strong>Daubaylia potomaca, n. sp., a nematode parasite of snails, with a note on other molluscs-associated nemas.</strong><br>
    <strong>B. G. CHITWOOD and M. B. CHITWOOD.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Several species of nemas have been reported from snails at various times, but up to the present, no comprehensive study of their nemic fauna has been made. The writers have examined several hundred snails of multiple groups and have found numerous species of nemas associated with them, among which was a form belonging to a new genus and species apparently related to the cephalobids. The name Daubaylia is proposed for this genus, which is considered the type of a new subfamily, DAUBAYLIINAEI, differing from the Cephalobinae in that the valves of the posterior part of the esophagus are entirely degenerated, and the stoma is significantly reduced. A new family, CEPHALOBIDAE, is proposed for the two subfamilies mentioned above; this family is characterized by the distinct joints of the stomatorhabdions, the absence of a distinct swelling at the base of the corpus, the presence of but one ovary in the female, and a particular distribution of the genital papillae in the male.

    <strong>Generic diagnosis</strong>. Daubayliinae: Lips 6, discrete; cephalic papillae 10 ( complete internal circle and 4 of external circle-laterodorsal and anteroventral), on lips; amphids dorsolateral, on lips. Stoma is reduced, and surrounded by fibrous tissue, only cheilorhabdions are well developed. Esophagus with subcylindrical corpus, long isthmUB, anguillulinoid pseudobulb.

    <strong>Description Daubaytia:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Male: </strong>1.52 to 1.82 mm. long by 24 to 30μ wide. The corpus of the esophagus is 98 to 100μ long by 6.3 to 7.5μ wide; the isthmus is 52 to 62μ long by 3.5 to 4.4μ. wide; pseudo bulb 37 to 50μ, long by 14 to 15μ wide. Nerve ring 116 to 125u, excretory pore 160 to 175μ, from the anterior extremity. Cloacal aperture 52 to 56μ. from the posterior extremity. Testis single, extending anteriad to within 640 to 660μ, from the anterior extremity, then reflexed 2 to 3 body diameters. Genital papillae, as shown in Figure 4D, phasmids are lateral and subterminal. Spicules 28 to 29μ long; gubernaculum 16μ long.

    <strong>Female:</strong> 1.74 to 1.84 mm. long by 30 to 40μ wide. Corpus of esophagus 106 to 109μ long by 8 to 10μ wide; isthmus 70 to 80μ long; pseudo bulb as in male. Nerve ring 125 to 180μ excretory pore 150 to 172μ from anterior extremity. Anus 100 to 106μ from posterior extremity ; tail conically attenuated, tip recurved dorsad ; phasmids 1/3 length of tail posterior to anus vulva 1.0 to 1.06 mm from anterior extremity ; monodelphic, prodelphic, ovary reflexed posteriad ; gonad extending to within 650 to 74Oμ of anterior extremity, ovary extending 340 to 45Oμ posterior to the vulva, then reflexed anteriad about 30μ to a blind end .<br>

    Baylis and Daubney (1922) described a species, Cephalobus seistamensis, from Gyraulus convexiusculus collected in Persia, which appears to be congeneric with Daubaylia Potomac the name of that species becoming Daubaylia feistiness ( Baylis and Daubney, 1922) n. comb. D. seistanensis differs from D. potomaca in that the body of the former is 4 .75 to 5 .3 times as long as the esophagus while in the latter it is 7 to 8 .5 times as long as the esophagus . In addition to D. potomaca, the writers have found the following species of nematodes in snails : Rhabditis monhystera ( larvae) from Opeas goodalli (eggs and liver) and Polygyra albolabrus (intestine) ; R. causanelli (larvae) from Opeas goodalli (muscles) ; Rhabditis sp. (encysted larvae) from Helix hortensis, Polygyra thyroides and Helix aspersa ; Cephalobus persegnis (adults) from Helix hortensis (liver and intestine) ; Cephalobus bütschlii (adults) from Polygyra albolabrus ; Dorylaimus stagnalis (1 dead) from Polygyra tridentata juxtidens (intestine) ; Actinolaimus sp. (1 dead) from Helisoma trivolvis (intestine) ; Aphelenchus avenae (adults) from Polygyra albolabrus (intestine) ; Aphelenchoides parietinus from Philomycus dorsalis (intestine) ; Cosmocercoides variabilis (adults) from Limax agrestis (intestine) and Opeas goodalli (intestine) ; metastrongylids (encysted larvae) from Helix lactea and Helix aspersa (muscles) ; and Daubaylia sp. (larvae) from Philomycus carolinensis (muscles) .
