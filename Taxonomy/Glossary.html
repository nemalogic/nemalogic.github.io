                    The bursa is a sucker- or cap-shaped cuticular structure found at the male's posterior end. It consists of two cuticular flaps, wings, or alae which together form the velum. The bursa can be either <strong>leptoderan</strong> or <strong>peloderan</strong> and often includes genital sensilla modified into rays. It is termed "open" if the two wings do not join before the cloacal opening and "closed" if they do.

It often has a triradiate lumen , is bounded by its own basal lamina , and is of mixed ectodermal and mesodermal origin. The pharynx is often wholly or partly muscular because it usually acts as a pump that sucks food into the mouth and transports it into the intestine.

                <dd>
                    A sensory structure capable of receiving stimuli from the external environment. Nematodes have many different types of sensilla, depending on whether they e.g. protrude above the cuticle or not, or whether they have an external opening or not.

                <dd>
                    A protruding sensillum that is longer than wide and often pointed, more or less resembling a microscopic hair. Most setae are assumed to be mechanoreceptors only, although some may have an adhesive function.

                <dd>
                    A hollow needle-like structure in the stoma of some groups of nematodes, used for piercing food items and ingesting their contents.

                <dd>
                    A flexible sac or expansion of the female reproductive system. In amphimictic and hermaphroditic species, it serves as storage site for sperm. In parthenogenetic species, it presumably serves no purpose and is usually less clearly developed. The spermatheca may be difficult to see, especially when large oocytes or eggs are present.

                    The entry region of the digestive system, between mouth opening and pharyngeal corpus . It consists of the buccal capsule and the buccal cavity , and can often be subdivided further by the presence of various sclerotizations, or on the basis of surrounding cell types.

                    A spear assumed to be derived from fusions of different parts of the stoma , and especially different parts of the buccal capsule . A stomatostylet occurs in the order Tylenchida and usually consists of three parts: an anterior cone, a central shaft and posterior knobs.
