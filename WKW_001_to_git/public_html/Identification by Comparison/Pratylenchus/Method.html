            <h1>Identification by comparison</h1>
            <p>
             The method of comparison, or matching, is straightforward in
                principle. The unknown specimen is first examined, and its characters
                are observed or investigated by experiment. It is then compared with
                all of the taxa of an appropriate group and identified with whichever of
                these agrees exactly or is the most similar. The comparison of the
                specimen with the reference taxa may involve counting the number of
                characters which agree or calculating some measure of the agreement
                (a similarity coefficient) based on character matches and mismatches.
                The result of the comparison may also be a short list of taxa rather than
                just one, from which a subjective choice must be made.
            </p><p>
                The simplest form of this method is that of direct comparison,
                where one takes the specimen and looks through a book of illustrations
                or photographs or through a collection of preserved specimens
                until one finds a taxon that 'looks the same. No objective assessment
                of similarity or identity may be used at all, or at any rate, not
                consciously. Many people would naturally do this to identify
                or 'name' something, they take a
                popular handbook on natural history, e.g. on birds, and just thumb  
                marked off by vertical lines. Each position in the table is filled with a
                symbol. The user is provided with or can make for himself a strip of
                card with tabs which can be folded over. The tabs are the same width
                as the columns. The specimen is examined, and the tabs are folded
                back for each character state which is observed. The strip is then slid
                down the table. The taxon, which is the correct one, will display only
                black squares (for 'yes') and perhaps some of the signs for 'variable.'
                when the strip is covering the right row of the table. The other
                symbols, for 'no' and 'inapplicable', will remain covered by tabs which
                have not been turned down. The advantage of this version is that it is
                easy to assess visually whether the specimen agrees with a taxon
                without needing to count the number of agreements.
