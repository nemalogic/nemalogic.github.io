            <span>Unfortunately, readily available information on the specific taxonomic classification of Muspiceina is limited. However, I can provide some general insights based on the current understanding of nematode taxonomy:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Order Rhabditida:</strong><span> Muspiceina is likely classified under the order Rhabditida. Rhabditida is a large and diverse order of nematodes encompassing many free-living and parasitic species.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span>Since suborders are subdivisions within an order, the parent of Muspiceina would be the order itself, which is most likely </span><strong>Rhabditida</strong><span>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Here's some additional information that might be helpful:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Nematode classification is a complex and evolving field. New information and discoveries can sometimes lead to revisions in taxonomy.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>If you're looking for more specific details on the classification of Muspiceina, you might try searching for academic publications that focus on this suborder or the Rhabditida order in general.</span>
