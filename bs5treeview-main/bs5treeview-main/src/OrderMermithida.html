    <span>The Mermithida, also known as hairworms or nematode-hairworms, are a phylum of parasitic roundworms. Their morphology is well-adapted for their parasitic lifestyle. Here's a breakdown of their key features:</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Body: </strong><span>Mermithids have long, slender, cylindrical bodies. They lack segmentation and have a smooth cuticle, which can be transparent or opaque depending on the species. Their body size varies greatly depending on the species, with some reaching lengths of up to 2 meters (over 6 feet)!</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Symmetry:</strong><span> They exhibit bilateral symmetry, meaning their left and right sides are mirror images of each other.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mouth and Digestive System:</strong><span> Their mouth is located at the anterior (front) end and is surrounded by sensory papillae. They have a muscular pharynx that helps them suck fluids from their hosts. Interestingly, adult mermithids lack a functional digestive system as they don't feed during their free-living adult stage. They rely on the nutrients they accumulated during their parasitic larval stage.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Reproductive System:</strong><span> Mermithids are dioecious, meaning there are separate sexes. Males are typically smaller than females. Fertilization is internal.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Lack of external segmentation:</strong><span> Unlike many other nematodes, mermithids don't have external segmentation on their bodies.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Nerve ring:</strong><span> They have a nerve ring located near the anterior end, which coordinates their nervous system.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Excretory system:</strong><span> They possess a simple excretory system consisting of paired canals that run along the length of their body and expel waste products through pores.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <span>It's important to note that there is some variation in morphology among different mermithid species. However, the features mentioned above are characteristic of the phylum as a whole.</span>
