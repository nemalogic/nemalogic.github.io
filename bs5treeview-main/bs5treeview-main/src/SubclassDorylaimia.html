    Dorylaimida, commonly referred to as Dorylaims, are a large order of nematodes (roundworms). Their morphology is quite distinct, with some key features setting them apart from other nematodes. Here's a breakdown of their key morphological characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Odontostyle:</strong> One of the most defining features of Dorylaimida is the presence of a movable mural tooth or a hollow spear called the odontostyle. This structure originates from a migrated stomal cell, the cheilostome, and is used for feeding. The cheilostome itself can be further divided into a vestibulum and a guiding apparatus, which may appear as a single or double ring around the odontostyle .

        <strong>Body Wall:</strong> Dorylaims typically have a well-developed body wall consisting of four layers: the cuticle, epidermis, body-cavity muscles, and hypodermis. The cuticle, the outermost layer, provides protection and support. The epidermis secretes the cuticle and plays a role in nutrient uptake and waste removal. The body-cavity muscles allow for locomotion, while the hypodermis helps maintain body shape and contributes to molting.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Digestive System:</strong> The digestive system of Dorylaimida is relatively simple. The mouth opening leads to a muscular pharynx that pumps food into the intestine. The intestine is a long, tubular structure where food is digested and absorbed. Waste products are eliminated through the anus located at the posterior end of the body.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Reproductive System:</strong> Dorylaims are dioecious, meaning there are separate sexes. Males have a single testis that produces sperm, while females have two ovaries that produce eggs. Fertilization is internal, and females lay eggs that develop into juveniles.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Nervous System:</strong> The nervous system of Dorylaimida is relatively simple, consisting of a nerve ring located around the esophagus and several longitudinal nerves that run along the body. The nerve ring coordinates sensory input and motor output.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are just some of the key morphological features of Dorylaimida. Their specific morphology can vary depending on the species, but these general characteristics provide a good overview of what makes them unique within the nematode phylum.
