    <span>The morphological description of Marimermithida is a bit complex due to a recent shift in taxonomy. Marimermithida was once considered a distinct order of parasitic nematodes, but recent genetic studies have shown that it's not a monophyletic group, meaning it doesn't encompass all descendants of a single common ancestor. Instead, the species originally classified as Marimermithida are now scattered throughout the nematode phylum.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>However, there are still some morphological features that many of these former Marimermithida species shared. These included:</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Elongated, thread-like bodies</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Reduced or absent mouth and digestive system in adults, as they absorb nutrients directly from their host</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Single, complex ovary in females</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Relatively simple sensory organs</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <span>Because these nematodes are internal parasites of marine invertebrates, they are difficult to study and not many species have been described. Additionally, the morphological characteristics can vary depending on the specific genus and host.</span>
