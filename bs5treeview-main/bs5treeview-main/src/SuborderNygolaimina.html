    <span>Information on the specific morphology of Nygolaimina is unfortunately scarce. Here's what we can gather:</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Limited Data:</strong><span> Nygolaimina is a relatively less studied suborder within Dorylaimida compared to others like Dorylaimina. Detailed morphological descriptions for this group seem to be less readily available.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Possible Overlaps with Dorylaimina:</strong><span> Since Nygolaimina falls within the Dorylaimida suborder, it's likely they share some of the core morphological features like the two-part esophagus, presence of esophageal glands, and a nerve ring surrounding the slender part of the esophagus.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Defining Characteristics:</strong><span> The specific features that distinguish Nygolaimina from other Dorylaimida suborders might lie in details like:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Lip region:</strong><span> The arrangement and number of papillae on the lip region could be different from Dorylaimina's two whorls of 6 and 10.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Amphid shape:</strong><span> The specific form of the amphid openings (slit, pore, etc.) might be a defining characteristic.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Odontostyle:</strong><span> The structure and size of the odontostyle (spear) could be unique to Nygolaimina.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Further Research:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Scientific publications: While information might be scarce, searching academic databases like </span><a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com/">https://www.webofknowledge.com/</a><span> or </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/">https://scholar.google.com/</a><span> for research articles on Nygolaimina morphology could yield more specific details. Look for keywords like "Nygolaimina", "morphology", "taxonomy", or "description".</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Expert Consultation: For in-depth understanding, consider contacting nematologists (roundworm specialists) who might have expertise in this specific suborder.</span>
