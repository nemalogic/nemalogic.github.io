            The Desmoscolecida are an order of nematodes characterized by a unique body structure different from other nematode groups. Here's a breakdown of their morphology:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Body Wall</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Thick with four layers: cuticle, epidermis, basement membrane, and musculature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The cuticle is further divided into three layers: the outer layer (corneum), the middle layer (mediam), and the inner layer (basale).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The presence of a deirid (sensory organ) close to the head distinguishes them from other nematodes .
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Head</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Distinct, set off from the body by a neck constriction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Contains a mouth surrounded by six lips.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Four cephalic setae (sensory bristles) are present on the head.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Amphimictic reproduction</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Desmoscolecids reproduce sexually with separate sexes (male and female).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Digestive System</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A muscular pharynx for feeding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A straight intestine ending in an anus located ventrally near the tail.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Nervous System</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Consists of a nerve ring surrounding the esophagus and longitudinal nerve cords.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Excretory System</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Includes a pair of renette cells that eliminate liquid waste products.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reproductive System</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Males have a single testis and a spicule for sperm transfer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Females have paired ovaries and oviducts with a vulva located on the ventral side.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tail</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Short and conical, with a single terminal sensory papilla.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here are some additional points to note about Desmoscolecida morphology:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                They are generally small, measuring from 0.3 to 5.0 millimeters in length.
            </li>
            <li>
                Their body shape is cylindrical and elongated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most Desmoscolecida are free-living, found in marine and brackish water sediments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some species are parasitic on other invertebrates.
            </li>
        </ul>
