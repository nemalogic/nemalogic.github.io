            The Heligmonellidae family is known for its morphological homogeneity, making identification between species quite challenging [1]. However, some key features can help identify members of this family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's what we know about the morphology of Heligmonellidae:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Microscopic worms:</strong> Like most nematodes, Heligmonellidae are microscopic, with a body size likely ranging in the hundreds of micrometers to a few millimeters [1].
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Round body:</strong> They share the characteristic round, elongated body shape typical of nematodes [1].
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Digestive system:</strong> Information on the specifics of the digestive system is lacking, but they presumably possess a digestive tract running the length of their body, as is common in nematodes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reproductive system:</strong> Details on the reproductive system are limited, but Heligmonellidae can likely reproduce sexually or asexually [1].
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, available information emphasizes the difficulty of identification due to the general similarity between species. More specific details regarding features like mouthparts, cuticle ornamentation, or spicule morphology (in males) might be necessary for accurate species identification.
