            Plectida is an order of nematodes, which are roundworms. They are multicellular, invertebrate organisms that are elongated and cylindrical in shape. Most nematodes are microscopic, but Plectida can range in size from 250 to 1000 micrometers.

            Here are some of the key morphological features of Plectida:

                        Females have two ovaries and oviducts

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>
                        By contracting muscles to whip their bodies back and forth
                    </li>

            </li>

            The morphology of Plectida can vary somewhat between different species, but these are the general characteristics. Some species may have additional features, such as setae (hairs) or caudal glands.
