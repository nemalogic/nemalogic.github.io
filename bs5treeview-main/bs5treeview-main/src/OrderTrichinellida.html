    The defining feature of Trichinellida morphology is a specialized structure in their pharynx called a stichosome. Here's a breakdown:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Pharynx:</strong> The pharynx in Trichinellida is narrow and thin-walled in the front section.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stichosome:</strong> The key feature, the stichosome, is located in the back of the pharynx. It's made up of unique single-celled glands called stichocytes. Each stichocyte has a duct that opens into the main cavity of the pharynx (pharyngeal lumen).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This structure is important for the Trichinellida's feeding process.
</p>
<p>
    It's important to note that Trichinellida was previously classified in the order Stichosomida due to the presence of the stichosome. However, recent research suggests this structure may have evolved independently in different nematode groups.
