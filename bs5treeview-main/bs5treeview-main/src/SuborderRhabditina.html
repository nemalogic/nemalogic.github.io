        <p>
            <span>The suborder Rhabditina within nematodes exhibits a specific morphology characterized by several key features:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Body:</strong><span> Elongated and cylindrical, bilaterally symmetrical, with a tapered anterior (head) end and a more blunt posterior (tail) end.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cuticle:</strong><span> A tough, non-cellular outer layer protecting the body.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Musculature:</strong><span> Longitudinal muscles running along the body for locomotion.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Digestive System:</strong><span> Complete digestive system with a mouth, muscular pharynx for food processing, a straight intestine, and an anus.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sensory Organs:</strong><span> Amphids (sensory organs near the head) for chemoreception and phasmids (sensory organs near the tail) for mechanosensation in some species.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Excretory System:</strong><span> Rete tubules, a network of canals that collect waste products and expel them through excretory pores.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reproductive System:</strong><span> Separate sexes, with males having a single testis and females having paired ovaries.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Additional characteristics of Rhabditina may include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Buccal cavity:</strong><span> A specialized mouth cavity for feeding, sometimes with teeth or other structures for scraping or piercing.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bursas:</strong><span> Copulatory structures in males, often paired, located near the tail.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spicules:</strong><span> Chitinous structures used for copulation in males.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Vulva:</strong><span> The female reproductive opening on the ventral side of the body.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Variations within Rhabditina:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Some species may have a reduced or absent pharyngeal apparatus if they have a symbiotic lifestyle.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>The number and arrangement of body pores can vary among species.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>The presence and structure of specialized reproductive organs like spicules and bursas can differ.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span>For a more in-depth exploration of Rhabditina morphology, you can consult scientific resources like research papers on nematode taxonomy or textbooks on nematology.</span>
