            The nematodes belonging to the order Rhabditida exhibit a diverse range of morphologies, but they generally share some common characteristics. Here's a breakdown of their key morphological features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Body size and shape:</strong> Rhabditid nematodes are typically microscopic, measuring around 1 millimeter in length. However, there can be significant variation within the order. Some species, like Protorhabditis hortulana, can be as small as 0.18 millimeters, while others, such as members of the Steinernenatide family, can reach up to 12 millimeters [4]. In cross-section, their bodies are usually round or cylindrical. After being relaxed or fixed, the body shape can differ between sexes. Females tend to curve into a "C" shape, while males take on a more "J" shape [4].
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cuticle:</strong> The nematode body is covered by a tough outer layer called the cuticle. In Rhabditids, the cuticle is composed of collagen and other proteins and often has transverse striations or ridges [4].
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lip region:</strong> The lip region, located at the anterior (front) end of the nematode, is a crucial feature for identification within the Rhabditida order. It can vary in shape and size and may have different numbers of lips or processes [2].
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stoma:</strong> The stoma is a muscular structure that functions as the mouth and pharynx of the nematode. In Rhabditids, the stoma can have a simple or complex structure with various chambers for food intake and processing [6].
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reproductive system:</strong> Rhabditids can be either dioecious (having separate sexes) or monoecious (having both sexes in one individual, like hermaphrodites). Males, when present, can be distinguished by their specialized tails and copulatory structures [5].
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tail:</strong> The tail morphology is another important taxonomic feature for Rhabditids. It can be conical, elongate, or have other shapes. The presence of phasmids (sensory organs) near the tail is also a characteristic feature [3].
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's important to remember that these are general characteristics, and there can be significant variation in morphology among the many families and species within the Rhabditida order.
