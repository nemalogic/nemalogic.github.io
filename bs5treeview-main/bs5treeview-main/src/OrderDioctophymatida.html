            <span>The Dioctophymatida are an order of parasitic nematodes known for their large size and red color. Here's a breakdown of their morphology:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Size:</strong><span> These are some of the biggest nematodes, with females reaching lengths of up to 100 cm, while males are smaller. For instance,</span> <em>Dioctophyma renale</em><span>, a parasite that infects the kidneys of minks and ferrets, can have females this large.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Color:</strong><span> Dioctophymatida are typically a red color, which is due to the presence of hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. This hemoglobin is likely acquired from their hosts.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Intermediate Hosts:</strong><span> Their life cycle involves an intermediate host, which is always an oligochaete annelid (segmented worm).</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Eggs:</strong><span> Dioctophymatida eggs have a distinct feature - thick shells with one or two polar opercula (lids) at each end.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Males:</strong><span> Male Dioctophymatida can be identified by their bell-shaped bursa, a structure near the tail end that aids in mating, and a single spicule, the reproductive organ in male nematodes.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
